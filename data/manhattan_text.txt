Fill a mixing glass a few inches high with ice. Add the whiskey, vermouth and bitters. Stir in a circular motion for about 30 seconds, or until the drink is very cold (if you'd like a drink with less bite, stir longer). Strain the liquid into a coupe or martini glass. Garnish with a cocktail cherry.
