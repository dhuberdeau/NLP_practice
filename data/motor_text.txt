INTRODUCTION

Motor learning is often studied using adaptation tasks (Cunningham 1989; Kluzik et al. 2008; Krakauer et al. 1999, 2000; Martin et al. 1996; Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994; Welch et al. 1993; Wolpert et al. 1995). In these tasks, a systematic perturbation (such as a visuomotor rotation) is applied during a movement, and participants must learn to adjust their actions to cancel the effects of the perturbation and regain baseline levels of performance. The ability to adapt to an imposed perturbation is supported by at least two underlying learning processes (Huberdeau et al. 2015b). One process, implicit recalibration, uses sensory-prediction errors to recalibrate movement by adjusting the motor commands issued to reach a particular goal (Mazzoni and Krakauer 2006; Taylor et al. 2010). This process is obligatory (Mazzoni and Krakauer 2006; Morehead et al. 2015) and appears to be cerebellum-dependent (Smith and Shadmehr 2005; Tseng et al. 2007). A second process, which we refer to as deliberate compensation, corrects movement errors through more explicit means, for instance by reaiming reaching movements toward a surrogate target (McDougle and Taylor 2019; Morehead et al. 2015; Taylor et al. 2014; Werner et al. 2015).

A central question in motor learning is how prior experience affects our ability to adapt in the future. In particular, which of the two processes that contribute to adaptation is responsible for savings, i.e., the fact that adaptation is faster the second time a perturbation is encountered (Krakauer et al. 2005; Morehead et al. 2015; Zarahn et al. 2008)? Various approaches have been devised to measure the extent of implicit recalibration: one approach is to explicitly instruct participants to disengage any strategy (Benson et al. 2011; Morehead et al. 2015; Taylor et al. 2014); another approach is to limit the amount of time available to prepare a movement (Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2011; Haith et al. 2015; Leow et al. 2017), which seems to prohibit participants from implementing time-consuming, deliberate compensation. Both approaches yield similar estimates of the relative contribution of implicit recalibration and deliberate compensation (Leow et al. 2017), and, critically, both have shown that savings is entirely attributable to deliberate compensation (Haith et al. 2015; Morehead et al. 2015; see also Hadjiosif and Smith 2013).

After a single exposure, therefore, prior experience only seems to improve future performance through time-consuming, deliberate compensation. However, a number of studies (Martin et al. 1996; Welch et al. 1993), along with everyday experience acting under perturbed mappings (e.g., using a computer mouse), suggest that people can, given enough practice, readily switch between different perturbation environments without having to engage slow, deliberate processes each time. Presumably, therefore, some aspect of adaptation must change with further practice, although it is unclear which.

We considered two potential ways in which practice might qualitatively alter the way in which we adapt to frequently experienced perturbations. First, it has been proposed that experience may lead to an increase in the learning rate of implicit recalibration (Gonzalez Castro et al. 2014; Herzfeld et al. 2014). Although the rate of implicit recalibration appears unchanged after adapting to a perturbation once (Haith et al. 2015; Morehead et al. 2015), it is possible that repeated practice adapting and readapting to the same perturbation might bring about an increase in rate.

An alternative possibility is that implicit recalibration might remain unaffected by experience, and, instead, practice might enable initially computationally intensive deliberate compensation to be stored in the form of a cached association between target location and required motor output, allowing it to be deployed rapidly and with minimal cognitive effort (Logan 1988). Crucially, however, we would still expect that compensation that was initially deliberate could still be voluntarily disengaged even after it has become cached, and thus it would remain distinct from implicit recalibration, which is involuntary (Mazzoni and Krakauer 2006; Morehead et al. 2015). The possibility that deliberate compensation could become cached accords with long-standing theories of skill learning that posit that practice promotes a transition in representation of a skill from being deliberate to automatic (Anderson 1982; Fitts 1964), potentially through caching of time-consuming computations (Haith and Krakauer 2018).

We examined these alternatives in two experiments in which human participants adapted to a series of alternating perturbations over 2 days. We assessed implicit recalibration using Aftereffect trials in which participants were instructed to withhold any deliberate strategy and bring their (unseen) hand directly to the target (Benson et al. 2011). In parallel, we assessed how well participants were able to compensate when preparation time (PT) was severely limited (Short-PT trials; Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2011; Haith et al. 2015; Leow et al. 2017). If practice altered the properties of implicit recalibration (increasing its rate or its asymptotic extent), then compensation during both Aftereffect trials and Short-PT trials should increase across cycles by similar magnitudes. On the other hand, if implicit recalibration remains unchanged but deliberate compensation becomes cached, the extent of compensation should improve when preparation time is limited (Short-PT trials), but there should be no change in Aftereffect trials.
