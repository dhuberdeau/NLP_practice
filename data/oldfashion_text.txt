Muddle the sugar cube and bitters with one bar spoon of water at the bottom of a chilled rocks glass. (If using simple syrup, combine bitters and one bar spoon of syrup.) Add rye or bourbon. Add one large ice cube, or three or four smaller cubes. Stir until chilled and properly diluted, about 30 seconds.
